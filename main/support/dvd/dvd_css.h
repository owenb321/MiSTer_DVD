// dvd_css.h — CSS-decrypted reads for a physical DVD-Video disc.
//
// The FPGA DVD core reads plaintext 2048-byte sectors over the generic sd_*
// block interface. This module supplies those sectors from the optical drive,
// decrypting CSS on the way, using a *user-supplied* libdvdcss that is loaded at
// runtime with dlopen(). No CSS code lives in this repository, and there is no
// build-time dependency on libdvdcss: if it is absent, dvd_css_open()
// simply fails and the caller falls back to a raw (scrambled) read, at which
// point the core shows its "CSS ENCRYPTED" notice — the user's cue to install
// the library (Scripts/install_dvdcss.sh).
